# Jarvis - Personal Assistant for PCs

As the laptops and computers is used almost by everyone, but no one has a tendency to use it as a tool to save their own lives or the other's lives. So why not take more benefits from scope of features of the laptops and computers and extend it for our own welfare. Our project is aimed to be used by everyone who owns a laptops and computers irrespective of brand.
Furthermore our application will perform users' command requests, which is texting, mailing, coding etc. In terms of advantages we can say that the driver will not need to buy anything in order to use this application. The purpose of this project is to reduce problems while using laptops and computers and ease user experience. This will also help user new to using computer or laptops ease their experience and help them in learning the working of computer. This is mainly for developers and coders but can also be used by other users helping those works through voice commands. The only way of 'communication' between the driver and his/her computer and laptops will be his/her voice and the application's voice.
